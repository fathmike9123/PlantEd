    name: 'Monstera',
    lightInformation:
        'Place your Monstera where it can receive medium to bright indirect light. While it is tolerant of lower light conditions, you may notice leggy growth as a result, so a spot where it will receive bright indirect light a few feet removed from a southern, western, or eastern facing window is ideal. While pothos do well in a variety of light conditions and can even tolerate low light, moderate indoor light is ideal. Outdoors they can be grown in shade to partial shade. Wherever you decide to display your pothos, just be sure to avoid direct sunlight.',
    waterInformation:
        'Water thoroughly and allow the top part of soil to dry out between waterings. Keep soil barely moist in winter. Yellowing lower leaves are usually a sign of overwatering. Provide good drainage.',
    temperatureInformation:
        'The monstera plant prefer normal room temperatures between 68–86 °F. Since it originally comes from tropical rain forests, a similar tropical and humid atmosphere will make this plant feel right at home.',
    fertilizerInformation: 'Feeding is important for lush, new growth. Feed every 2 weeks spring through autumn with a balanced liquid fertilizer diluted by half. Feed monthly in winter.',

    name: 'Pothos',
    lightInformation:
        'They do well in bright indirect light as well as low light and can be grown in dry soil or in vases of water. They will thrive in nutrient rich soil, but do almost as well in nutrient poor soil. Pothos plants make a great addition to you bathroom or office because they can tolerate low light.',
    waterInformation:
        'Pothos do best when their soil is allowed to dry out between waterings. To achieve this watering technique allow only the top two inches to dry being sure that the roots are still moist. If the leaves are wilting or turning brown, you should water the plant more often.',
    temperatureInformation:
        'To keep this plant as healthy as possible, keep it at temperatures between 60-85 ºF (15-29 ºC) year round. It will withstand occasional cold snaps down to 50 ºF (10 ºC), but below this, the plant will die.',
    fertilizerInformation:
        'Pothos needs to be fertilized with a balanced 10-10-10 or 20-20-20 fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during their growing season. Lack of nutrients can slow the growth of your pothos; thus, fertilizing them is crucial.',

  Plant(
    name: 'Echinacea Purpurea',
    lightInformation: 'Varies by species and zone, but typically thrive in full sun. Some may tolerate partial shade, and in hotter southern climates, some light afternoon shade can prevent burning.',
    waterInformation: 'Tolerant of drought, but does best in average, dry to medium moisture. Water regularly, but let soil dry out in between. Coneflowers need at least an inch of water weekly.',
    temperatureInformation:
        'The temperature experts specifically recommend for E. purpurea coneflowers varies from 40 through 59 F, with the majority at the lower end of the range. Gardeners in areas with winter temperatures consistently in this range can place trays outdoors.',
    fertilizerInformation:
        'Fertilize coneflowers in early spring, using a granular, time-release fertilizer with a ratio such as 12-6-6. Apply the fertilizer at a rate of 1 pound for every 100 square feet of garden space just before the emergence of new leaves.',

  Plant(
    name: 'Money Plant',
    lightInformation: 'Light-wise, the best situation for a Chinese money plant is bright light, with no direct sunlight. Direct sun scorches leaves, and light shade may encourage larger leaves.',
    waterInformation:
        'The Chinese money plant prefers a well-draining potting soil, and a pot with drainage holes is necessary. The soil needs to mostly dry out between waterings, with more watering required in warmer, sunnier weather. If the leaves start to look slightly droopy, thats a sign that the plant needs water.',
    temperatureInformation:
        'The Money Plant enjoys warm temperatures. It is most happy in a temperature range of 55°F to 86°F (13°C to 30°C). It will not do well in temperatures that constantly remain below 50°F (10°C).',
    fertilizerInformation:
        'You really only need to fertilize Chinese money plants once a month. ... Use a liquid organic houseplant fertilizer by diluting it to half of the recommended strength and then watering the plant with it. Do not fertilize a dry plant; instead water it first and then fertilize the next day.',
